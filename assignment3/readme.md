Here I have applied Canny Edge detection and each of the images are present in the respective folder names 

Also here are 4 input images and I tweeked the different sigma t1 and t2 values

For input_0 to see the pathways more clearly I lowed the sigma a bit and lowerd each of t1 t2 very very slightly to remove the unwanted dots as well as the light path
next to the road is also visible.
sigma   = 0.65
t1      = 0.04
t2      = 0.14


For input_1 As it is has lot of minute details but keeping the sigma too low can make it clumsy so I choose an appropriate but low.
sigma   = 0.50
t1      = 0.04
t2      = 0.16

For input_2 as its a water body and boundary should be detailed.
sigma   = 0.6
t1      = 0.05
t2      = 0.15

For input_3 as the smooth image is more clear and will have better details visible 
sigma   = 0.5
t1      = 0.05
t2      = 0.15
